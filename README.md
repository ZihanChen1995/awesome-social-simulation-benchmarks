**English** · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Benchmarks and human ground-truth data for evaluating LLM-driven social simulation, sorted by **which layer of validation they support** rather than by publication date.

The word "benchmark" means three different things in this field. Comparing results across layers is how people end up citing an unrelated number:

- **L1 — Individual fidelity.** One agent plays one real person. Does it answer the way that person answered?
- **L2 — Interaction and social intelligence.** Several agents interact. Is the process and outcome any good?
- **L3 — Emergent macro alignment.** A population runs. Do the collective patterns match real-world statistical regularities?

Every entry carries a **Data** column: whether real human comparison data is actually obtainable. When picking something to validate against, that is the only question that matters, and a date-sorted list cannot answer it.

## Inclusion Criteria

- Publicly addressable, and the link resolves.
- The Data column states what you actually get: real human comparison data, synthetic scenarios, or evaluation code only.
- It fits one of the three layers. If an entry does not fit, the taxonomy needs revising, not the entry forcing.

## State of the Field

L1 has been unified by SimBench. L2 is crowded and increasingly homogeneous. L3 is thin, and each entry is bound to its own framework. Benchmarks at L3 with real macro-level human comparison data still number in the single digits, and none of them are framework-agnostic.

Additions, corrections, and better descriptions are all welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Submitting in one language only is fine; a maintainer will fill in the other.
